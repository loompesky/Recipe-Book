Kenkey is a traditional Ghanaian dish made from fermented corn and cassava dough, wrapped in corn or banana leaves and then boiled. It's often paired with a variety of accompaniments, including fried fish, making for a flavorful, hearty meal. Here's how to prepare Kenkey with Fried Fish:

Ingredients:

For Kenkey:

- 4 cups corn dough (fermented)
- 1 cup corn husk or banana leaves (for wrapping)

For Fried Fish:

- 4 medium-sized whole fish (such as tilapia, mackerel, or red fish)
- 1 tablespoon ground chili pepper or cayenne
- 1 tablespoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder (or minced fresh garlic)
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- Salt to taste
- Vegetable oil for frying

For Serving (Optional):

- Shito (Ghanaian pepper sauce)
- Sliced onions and tomatoes

Directions:

Preparing Kenkey:

1. Preparation of Wrapping Leaves: Soak the corn husks or banana leaves in warm water to make them pliable. Clean them thoroughly and set aside.
2. Dough Preparation: Take a quarter of the fermented dough and add some water to make a smooth paste. Cook this paste on low heat, continuously stirring until it becomes partially gelatinized and has a dough-like consistency.
3. Mixing: Mix the cooked dough with the remaining fermented dough. Mix thoroughly until it's well combined.
4. Wrapping: Take a portion of the mixed dough and place it onto a corn husk or banana leaf. Wrap the dough inside the leaf, folding the edges to seal it completely.
5. Cooking: Place the wrapped kenkey into a large pot. Add water and let it boil for about 1 to 2 hours. The kenkey is done when it becomes firm to the touch.
6. Cooling: Remove the kenkey from the pot and let it cool before unwrapping.

Preparing Fried Fish:

1. Fish Preparation: Clean the fish thoroughly, ensuring that scales and guts are removed. Make a few diagonal cuts on both sides of each fish for the marinade to penetrate better.
2. Marinating: In a bowl, combine ground chili pepper, ground ginger, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt. Rub this spice mix all over the fish, ensuring that it enters the cuts made earlier. Let the fish marinate for at least 30 minutes.
3. Frying: In a frying pan, heat vegetable oil on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, fry each fish until it's golden brown and crispy on both sides.
4. Draining: Place the fried fish on paper towels to remove excess oil.

Serving:

- Serve the kenkey with fried fish on the side.
- Add some shito, sliced onions, and tomatoes if desired.
- To eat, take a piece of kenkey, dip it in the shito or any preferred sauce, and enjoy it with a piece of fried fish.

Note: Preparing kenkey can be time-consuming, but the result is well worth the effort. The dish is both delicious and deeply rooted in Ghanaian culinary tradition.
