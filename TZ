Tuo Zaafi (commonly referred to as TZ) is a popular dish in Northern Ghana. It's a smooth, stretchy dough usually served with a variety of soups, including green leafy soups like ayoyo (jute leaves) or with meat stews. Here's a basic recipe for Tuo Zaafi:

 Ingredients:

For Tuo Zaafi:

- 3 cups of maize or millet flour
- 1 cup cassava flour
- Water

For Ayoyo Soup:

- 1 cup dried or fresh ayoyo (jute) leaves
- 1 medium-sized onion, chopped
- 2-3 scotch bonnet peppers (adjust to taste), blended
- 1 tablespoon dawadawa or fermented locust beans (optional)
- 1 teaspoon ground fish or shrimp
- Salt to taste
- Water or meat broth
- Protein: meat, fish, or poultry, as desired

Directions:

Preparing Tuo Zaafi:

1. Initial Mixture: In a pot, mix a cup of the maize or millet flour with water to form a smooth, thin paste. Ensure there are no lumps.
2. Cooking: Place the pot on medium heat and cook the mixture, constantly stirring until it partially solidifies. This should take about 10 minutes.
3. Mixing Flours: Add the cassava flour and the remaining maize or millet flour to the pot and mix thoroughly with water. The consistency should be a bit thicker than the initial mixture.
4. Final Cooking: Keep stirring and cook for another 10-15 minutes until the mixture becomes smooth and stretchy. If it's too hard, you can add a bit of water to soften it. Once it's done, mold it into balls and set aside.

Preparing Ayoyo Soup:

1. Preparation: If using dried ayoyo leaves, soak them in water until they're rehydrated. If using fresh leaves, wash them thoroughly.
2. Blending: Blend the ayoyo leaves with a bit of water until it forms a smooth paste.
3. Cooking: In a pot, add some water or meat broth and bring it to a boil. Add the chopped onions, blended scotch bonnet peppers, and dawadawa or fermented locust beans if using. Allow it to simmer for a few minutes.
4. Adding Ayoyo: Pour the blended ayoyo leaves into the pot and stir continuously to prevent lumping. Add the ground fish or shrimp for added flavor.
5. Protein: If you're using meat, fish, or poultry, ensure it's well-cooked and add it to the soup.
6. Simmering: Let the soup simmer for about 10-15 minutes. Add salt to taste.

Serving:

- Serve the Tuo Zaafi balls with the ayoyo soup. You can also have some fried fish or meat on the side if desired.

Note: Tuo Zaafi and its accompaniments are versatile, and there are various ways to prepare them. Adjustments can be made based on personal preferences and regional variations.
