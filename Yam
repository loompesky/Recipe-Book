Yam and egg stew (often referred to as yam and egg sauce) is a popular breakfast dish in Nigeria and other parts of West Africa. The soft, boiled yam slices paired with a spicy, savory egg stew make for a hearty meal. Here's a simple recipe to prepare it:

Ingredients:

 For Yam:

-1 medium-sized yam: peeled and cut into round slices
-Salt to taste
-Water for boiling

For Egg Stew:

- 4 large eggs
- 3 medium-sized tomatoes, chopped
- 1 medium-sized onion, chopped
- 2-3 scotch bonnet peppers (adjust to your heat preference), finely chopped
- 1 bell pepper, chopped (optional)
- 2-3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon ground pepper or chili powder (optional for extra heat)
- 1/2 teaspoon thyme (optional)
- Salt to taste
- 1 stock cube (optional for added flavor)
- A small bunch of chopped parsley or scent leaves (optional for garnish)

Directions:

Preparing the Yam:

1. In a large pot, add the yam slices. Add enough water to cover the yams. Add a pinch of salt.
2. Boil the yams on medium heat until they are soft and cooked through. You can test for doneness by poking a slice with a fork; it should go through without resistance.
3. Once done, drain the water and set the yam slices aside in a serving dish.

Preparing the Egg Stew:

1. Preparation: Beat the eggs in a bowl and add a pinch of salt. Set aside.
2. Cooking: In a frying pan or skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and saut√© until they become translucent.
3. Add the chopped tomatoes, bell pepper (if using), and scotch bonnet peppers to the onions. Fry the mixture until the tomatoes are fully cooked, and the oil starts to float on top.
4. Season the tomato mixture with salt, ground pepper or chili powder, thyme, and the stock cube if you're using one. Stir well.
5. Reduce the heat to low, then pour the beaten eggs over the tomato mixture. Let it sit for a minute before stirring so that the eggs form soft curds.
6. Gently stir the eggs into the tomato mixture, ensuring they're well combined but still maintain some structure. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the eggs are fully set but not overcooked.
7. Check the seasoning and adjust if necessary. Remove from heat.

Serving:
1. Serve the boiled yam slices with the egg stew on the side. You can garnish with chopped parsley or scent leaves if desired.
2. Enjoy your meal while hot!

Note: Yam and egg stew is versatile. You can add other ingredients like smoked fish, sausages, or mixed vegetables to the egg stew to enhance its flavor and nutritional content. Adjust the recipe to suit your preferences.
